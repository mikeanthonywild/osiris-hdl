CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-249] Generated clock linebuffer_test_i/rgb2dvi_0/U0/SerialClk has no logical paths from master clock clk_out1_linebuffer_test_clk_wiz_0_1.
Resolution: Review the path between the master clock and the generated clock with the schematic viewer and correct the -source option. If it is correct and the master clock does not have a timing path to the generated clock, define the generated clock as a primary clock by using create_clock.
